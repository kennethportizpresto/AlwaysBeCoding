# Data Structures
"""
There are two types of data structures: primative and non-primative data structures.
Primative data structures include: Integer, Booleans, Character, string.

There are two types of non-primative data structures: Linear and non-Linear data structure
Linear data strutures: Arrays, lists, Linked-List, Stacks, Heaps, and Queues.
Non-Linear data structures: Trees and Graphs

Trees have a hierarchical data structure. There is a parent and child relationship although unlike graphs they do not
contain acyclic relationships.

Primatives can store one value with a specific data type. While non-primatives can store many values of the same type or store many values with different datatypes.
